# Flower shop.

The website of the flower shop was created for educational purposes and is not a website of any brand.

## Programming languages and platforms.

This project was created using the following programming languages:

1. **HTML** -Standardized hypertext markup language for documents for web browsing in a browser.
2. **SCSS** - A formal language for decorating and describing the appearance of a document written using a markup language.
3. **GitHub Pages** - A platform for hosting static websites directly from GitHub repositories.

The site is live at https://leramakarshina.github.io/cite/

## Differences of the site from others on a similar topics.
This project is distinguished by its simplicity, the availability of ready-made bouquets and at the same time you can order both the finished product and press the order button (where you can then find out the assortment of flowers and assemble the composition with the help of a consultant).

## Why a website on this topic ?

I chose this theme because my friend works as a florist, and in the store where she works, there is only a logo and an order number. I referred to her questions and problems related to work, and decided to write a simple website for a flower shop.
